## Introduction:

In this project, I used **PySpark** to load, clean, transform, and analyze sales data for a business that needed me to build certain KPIs. By leveraging joins, aggregations, and data transformation/cleaning techniques, I was able to do so and provide analytical insights to drive growth for the business.

## Data:

I worked with 2 datasets: one customer related dataset csv file and one product related dataset csv file.

Customer data: product id, customer id, order date, location, source order
Product data: product id, product name, price

## KPIs calculated:
1. Total amount spent by each customer
2. Total amount spent by each food category
3. Total amount of sales in each month
4. Yearly sales
5. Quarterly sales
6. How many times each product was purchased
7. Top 5 ordered items
8. Most ordered product
9. Frequency of customer visits
10. Total sales by each country
11. Total sales by order source
